Material_Database_SI.xlsx has material properties for lamina, fiber, and matrix. See excel workbook for material names and material ID numbers.

Outputs: ply failure using max stress criteria, ABD matrix, Resultant forces

Inputs needed are : ply by ply layup, material thickness (only allow uniform thickness across all plys rn),  material choices (See material Database), Tempature change, in-plane resultants, bending resultants
