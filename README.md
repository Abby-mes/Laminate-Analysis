Project: Laminate_Plates_Analysis
Save Material_Database_SI.xlsx to your folder and run the .m file. 
Outputs: ply failure using max stress criteria, ABD matrix, Resultant forces
Inputs needed are : ply by ply layup, material thickness (only allow uniform thickness across all plys rn),  material choices (See material Database), Tempature change, in-plane resultants, bending resultants
